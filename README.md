# SHOPNO
SHOPNO is my personal pet project designed to practice, improve and showcase my web development and design skills. The project arose as a result of using an interesting layout that I found and decided to "revive".
The main goal of this project is not just to create an ordinary landing page, but also to use it as a platform for experiments and improvements. 
This is my first serious pet project, so please don't judge too harshly. I believe that every stage of this project contributes to my professional growth and I am open to feedback and improvements.

The project is also available online. You can check it out at this link: [SHOPNO](https://hnatkruk.github.io/shopno/).
