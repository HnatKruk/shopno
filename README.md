# Hi, I'm Taras

This is my own Pet Project called SHOPNO
It was created to show my skills in Front-End Development
You can visit it at the link [SHOPNO](https://elbiliardo.github.io/shopno/)

## Technologies used:

### HTML

I tried to follow the principles of Validity, Semantic and Accessibility

### CSS

#### `Flexbox` 
The project is fully coded on Flexbox technology (there are also separate projects fully coded Grid).

#### `RWD` 
Also the complete project is Responsive Web Design used by Media Queries by being displayed on any screen starting from 320px.
Desktop First: I used Desktop First following the PSD template but also familiar with Mobile First.

#### `SCSS` 
I also coded an almost complete project to the SASS preprecessor in SCSS syntax.

### JS

#### `React` 
The project is fully coded on React technology using its packages, best demonstrated on React Hook From, for its validation.
I also use React Hooks and Functional Components in my development (unfortunately this project did not allow me to demonstrate this in full)

### Cross Browser

I also tested Cross Browser on Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Opera and Microsoft Edge.
They all perfectly reflect my project (unfortunately I couldn't check Safari)

These are not all my skills because they are just a PSD template, in reality my knowledge and skills are much deeper than shown in this description, so I'm waiting for your message.
